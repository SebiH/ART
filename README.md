Mixed Reality Data Visualisation

3D Data Visualisation in a Mixed Reality scenario. Written for my Bachelor Thesis at the  University of Konstanz, Germany.

Uses LeapMotion, Oculus Rift with OVRVision Pro cameras and Unity 3D (Windows only due to Emgu/OpenCV bindings).

**Title / everything is *heavily* work in progress.**
